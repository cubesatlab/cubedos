  We are developing an open source application framework, called CubedOS, for flight software on
  CubeSat nano-satellites. CubedOS is written in \SPARK\ 2014 and proved free of runtime error.
  It uses a message passing architecture where each concurrently executing module processes
  messages from an associated mail box and sends messages to other mail boxes. CubedOS
  encourages a client/server software architecture where server modules process request messages
  and return reply messages to clients. Message data is encoded using the external data
  representation (XDR) standard. Each module thus provides encoding and decoding subprograms so
  the clients of a module are not required to manage message encodings themselves. These
  subprograms are tedious for module authors to produce manually. In this paper we present
  XDR2OS3, a tool that enables CubedOS module authors to specify message structures using an
  interface language that follows the XDR standard, extended to account for the special
  properties of \SPARK\ (such as constrained subtypes and message invariants). XDR2OS3 generates
  a \SPARK\ package containing suitable encoding and decoding subprograms for each module. The
  output of XDR2OS3 can be analyzed by the \SPARK\ tools and proved free of runtime error.
