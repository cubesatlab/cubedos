-- This module is a skeleton, with comments, showing how to set up a standard CubedOS module.
-- CubedOS modules do not need to follow this structure exactly, but it is recommended to at
-- least start here. Note that many of the comments should be edited/erased in a real
-- application.

   -- directly aware of their own ID numbers but instead look them up from the Name_Resolver
   -- just as clients must.
